# Circular Economy and Sustainable Resource Management: Comprehensive Development

This project simulates the transition of Bangladesh's economic model from linear to circular by 2030, focusing on resource efficiency, waste minimization, and environmental sustainability. The simulation covers key sectors such as plastics, textiles, waste management, agriculture, construction, and e-waste, and models the impact of various policy levers and circular economy strategies.

## Features
- Sector-based simulation (Plastics, Textiles, Waste, Agriculture, Construction, E-Waste)
- Policy levers and scenario modeling
- Yearly projections for waste generation, recycling, and landfill
- Extensible modular codebase for further research and development

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deluair/Circular-Economy-and-Sustainable-Resource-Management-Comprehensive-Development.git
   cd Circular-Economy-and-Sustainable-Resource-Management-Comprehensive-Development
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r circular_economy_sim/requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   python -m circular_economy_sim.main
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python circular_economy_sim/main.py
   ```

## Output
The simulation prints yearly waste, recycling, and landfill statistics for each sector from 2024 to 2030.
